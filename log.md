# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: January 9th, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Started my first project - creating a basic blog template using Bootstrap 4, that I will then use to make my own blog.

**Thoughts**: Today went fairly well, there was a minor hiccup with the dropdown function of the Navbar - it seems that the code on the source website doesn't work without using some JavaScript - however it works now.

### Day 2: January 10th, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Continued with the blog project - I now have a finished homepage template, and a finished template for a blog post. I added a small sidebar to both to showcase popular and new posts.

**Thoughts**: The work went much faster today, and I was able to re-use a lot of the code from yesterday. I need to tidy it all up a bit more once I have finished all of the templates.

### Day 3: January 12th, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Today I turned my completed html documents into PHP documents so that I could also create header and footer documents that can be re-used for every page of the site instead of having to re-write the same code for the navbar and the JavaScript.

**Thoughts**: Although the project is now harder to work on as PHP requires a server connection in order to be able to see the work, this will make it much easier to create new pages and content for the site.

### Day 4: January 13th, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Today I created a template for an index page for blog posts - ideally designed to contain links to and descriptions of a month's worth of blog posts on a single page.

**Thoughts**: I had some issues with the alignment of the pagers for navigating - they are currently in a fixed position, but I would like to try to make them as responsive as the rest of the site.

### Day 5: January 14th, 2017

**Today's Progress**: I finished the last couple of pages for the blog template - a basic About page, and a Contact page that will send an email to the one specified in the send-email.php document.

**Thoughts**: Most of the code I re-used from some old projects - the contact form only needed to be re-styled to fit with the new site. I feel that I should go through the code to check that I understand how & why it works.

### Day 6: January 15th, 2017

**Today's Progress**: I have finished the blog template - it is ready to be filled with content and used.

**Thoughts**: I'm not 100% happy with the pager on the post-index-template.php, but it is functional and that will do for now.
