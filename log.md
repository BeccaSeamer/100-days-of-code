# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: January 9th, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Started my first project - creating a basic blog template using Bootstrap 4, that I will then use to make my own blog.

**Thoughts:** Today went fairly well, there was a minor hiccup with the dropdown function of the Navbar - it seems that the code on the source website doesn't work without using some JavaScript - however it works now.
